# SignalDistanceEncoder
A deep learning framework to learn signal-specific distance metrics via a convolutional autoencoder, structuring the latent space to reflect intrinsic similarity between complex time series. Applicable to synthetic signals and biomedical data such as ECG, this model enables robust proximity estimation, clustering, and anomaly detection.
